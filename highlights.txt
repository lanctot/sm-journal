Highlights:
We analyze the algorithms for computing strategies for simultaneous move games.
We provide an extensive survey on the existing algorithms.
We describe in details our recent novel exact and approximative algorithms.
Novel exact algorithm dominates in the offline equilibrium strategy computation.
Novel use of regret-matching in MCTS dominates in the online game play.
