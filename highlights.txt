Highlights:
We analyze the algorithms for computing strategies for simultaneous move games.
We describe both novel and existing algorithms that compute strategies for this class of games.
The algorithms include both exact algorithms as well as Monte Carlo sampling algorithms.
Novel exact algorithm dominates in the offline equilibrium strategy computation.
Results among sampling algorithms provide unique insights into their performance and identify favorable settings and domains for different sampling algorithms.
