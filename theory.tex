What to include in this section?

\begin{enumerate}
\item Time and space complexities of each algorithm
\item Mention any theoretical properties (i.e. reference to upper/lower bound lemmas for serialized games)
\item Examples of worst and best cases and what effect this can have on the algorithms
\item An overview of our NIPS paper convergence results for sample-based algorithms
\end{enumerate}
