\begin{abstract}
Simultaneous move games model discrete, multistage interactions where at each stage 
players choose their actions simultaneously. This formalism can model discrete 
approximations of realistic scenarios such as agents in a physical environment and 
has been used to express games in general game playing. 
In this paper, we survey the existing literature on algorithms that compute strategies
for two-player zero-sum simultaneous move games.
We present algorithms for both the offline case, where computation time is abundant, and 
the online case, where computation time is limited. 
We show how modern approaches compute strategies and compare the quality of the resulting
strategies in the worst case and expected case, in several 
domains previously used in the literature and over a spectrum of randomly generated games.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Strategic decision-making in multiagent environments is an important problem in artificial intelligence. 
With the growing number of agents interacting with humans and with each other, the need to 
understand these strategic interactions at a fundamental level is becoming increasingly important. 
Today, agent interactions occur in many diverse situations, such as e-commerce, social networking, and 
general-purpose robotics, each of which create complex problems that arise from conflicting agent 
preferences. 

Much research has been devoted to developing algorithms that reason about or learn in sequential (or multi-step) 
interactions. One example, adversarial search has been a central topic of artificial intelligence 
since the inception of the field itself, leading to very strong rational behavior in 
Chess~\cite{Campbell02deepblue}. Advances in machine learning for multi-step interactions 
(\eg reinforcement learning) have led to self-play algorithms that can achieve master level play 
in Backgammon~\cite{Tesauro95TDGammon}. 

The most common model for these multistage environments is one with strictly {\it sequential} 
interactions. That is, each player chooses an action when it is their turn to act, and the environment 
generates a new state, with the next player's turn to act, and so on. This model is sufficient in many 
settings, such as Chess and Backgammon~\cite{AIbook}, but is not a good representation of the environment when agents 
are allowed to act simultaneously, such as in real-world situations like auctions and autonomous driving. 

In this paper, we present several algorithms for computing strategies in adversarial settings where
players are allowed to act simultaneously. One of the key differences compared to strictly sequential 
games is that the agents may need to use randomized (or \textit{mixed}) strategies in order to play optimally.
This means that agents may need to randomize over several actions in some situations of the game. 
This does not occur in strictly sequential games, where optimal solution always exists in pure strategies.
In our analysis we cover both the offline case, where computation time is 
abundant and strategies are precomputed, and the online case, where computation time is limited and 
agents must search online. We are concerned both with the quality of strategies based on 
their worst-case performance in theory and their observed performance in practice. We compare and 
contrast the algorithms and choices in the offline and online cases, and thoroughly evaluate each 
algorithm on a suite of games. Our collection of games cover many games used for benchmark purposes
in the previous work, but we also performed experiments on randomly generated games. These games differ 
in number of possible actions, number of moves before the game ends, variance of the utility values,
and whether the agents need to use mixed strategies in order to play optimally.
